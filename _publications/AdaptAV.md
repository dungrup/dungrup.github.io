title: "AdaptAV: Continuous Adaption of Vision Models for Autonomous Vehicles Using Cloud-based Oracle"

permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'Deploying vision perception models in autonomous vehicles requires that we prioritize inference speeds, resulting in a
model with shallower architectures and lesser model parameters
(i.e., more pruned). Such small models do not generalize well,
which could result in poor performance when encountered with
novel scenarios. We propose a system that overcomes this by
continuously retraining the vision models on the cloud with
data uploaded by vehicles. We leverage the abundant compute
resources, including machine learning accelerators, of the cloud
to run a state-of-the-art, highly accurate oracle model that will
guide the retraining process of the on-vehicle model. This newly
trained model is transmitted to the vehicle over the network and
is utilized by the vehicle for perceptions, leading to improved
inference accuracy over time.'

Deploying vision perception models in autonomous vehicles requires that we prioritize inference speeds, resulting in a
