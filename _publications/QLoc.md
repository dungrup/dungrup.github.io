permalink: /publication/2025-04-15-qloc
excerpt: 'Mobile autonomous systems are increasingly being
deployed in controlled environments worldwide, with large
fleets of ground robots performing tasks such as delivery
and surveillance. These systems require reliable localization
to navigate through such environments. While the Global
Positioning System (GPS) is commonly implemented in these
systems, urban environments can introduce inaccuracies due
to signal blockages caused by large buildings and structures,
or even complete signal loss. This paper proposes a rapid and
cost-effective localization method using a sensor ubiquitous in
autonomous systems: cameras. We introduce a system that uses
vision-based machine learning techniques to detect common
landmarks in camera streams and subsequently predict loca-
tion. The system employs advanced object detection models
for landmark identification and recurrent neural networks
for vehicle localization based on the detected landmarks. We
prototype these techniques on a small-scale autonomous vehicle
platform to demonstrate the system’s capabilities and evaluate
its accuracy and execution efficiency in real-world scenarios.'

Mobile autonomous systems are increasingly being
deployed in controlled environments worldwide, with large

to navigate through such environments. While the Global
