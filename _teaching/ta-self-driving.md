As a Teaching Assistant for the "Self-Driving Cars: Theory and Practice" course, I was involved in implementing a comprehensive curriculum that equipped students with the essential skills required to build a fully autonomous vehicle. Through a hands-on approach, we guided students in mastering cutting-edge technologies such as ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2) and computer vision techniques. The course culminated in a capstone project where students applied their knowledge to develop a 1:16 scale fully autonomous vehicle capable of navigating a simulated track environment and included features such as auto-parking, stop sign detection and obstacle avoidance.
