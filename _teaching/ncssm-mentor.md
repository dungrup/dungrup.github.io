I mentored 7 high school students form North Carolina School of Science and Maths over a span of 2 Summers ('24 and '23). The students were asked to develop applications relevant to autonomous robots. The students developed an autonomous "pet" robot that would use computer vision to follow a subject. The students also developed a low-latency streaming application that would allow them to remotely operate the robot.
