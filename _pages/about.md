I am a Computer Science researcher and Ph.D. candidate at North Carolina State University passionate about developing innovative systems that push the boundaries of computing at the edge. My current research focuses on creating accountable and secure systems for autonomous vehicles.

I have nearly three years of professional experience, having worked with [KPIT](https://www.kpit.com) and [Analog Devices](https://www.analog.com/en/index.html). At KPIT, I contributed to the development of ADAS applications on various AI-capable embedded platforms. At Analog Devices, I was involved in the development and testing of device drivers for the SHARC+ cores of next-generation Digital Signal Processors. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Manipal Institute of Technology (MIT), Manipal.
