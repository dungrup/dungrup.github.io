Hello and welcome to my website! I'm a Computer Science researcher currently pursuing my Ph.D. at North Carolina State University. My current research passions lie in autonomous systems and robotics.

While my work does involve the trending fields of AI, robotics, and autonomous vehicles, my specific focus is ensuring these systems are robust, accountable, and secure. Essentially, I'm dedicated to making sure tomorrow's robots are not only better but also operate safely when faced with malicious interference or unpredictable environmental conditions.

Before pursuing my Ph.D., I worked at [KPIT](https://www.kpit.com) where I developed ADAS applications for a top Japanese automotive company. I also interned at [Analog Devices](https://www.analog.com/en/index.html) where I was involved in device driver development for ADI's next-gen Digital Signal Processors (DSPs). I earned my Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Manipal Institute of Technology (MIT), Manipal.
